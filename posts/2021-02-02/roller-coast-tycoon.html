I played the second edition that came out in 2002. I recently rediscovered the game and am amazed by how fun it still is to put together roller coasters, set prices for hamburger stands, strategically place benches and trash cans on paths near nauseating rides, run marketing campaigns, and listen in on the thoughts of the park visitors. The isometric view and low-res graphics are very attractive and the sound effects really make it feel fun and alive.</p><p>Unfortunately it only runs on Windows machines, and I have a Mac. A few years ago I was able to figure out how to get it working with [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/), a compatability layer that translates Windows operating system API calls into code that Unix-based operating systems, like macOS, can understand. But Wine can't yet handle 64-bit apps, so it's been broken on macOS Catalina, which doesn't let you run 32-bit apps.Luckily I was able to find [PlayOnMac](https://www.playonmac.com/en/), which apparently has been adapted to be able to handle 64-bit apps, so I was able to install that, install Windows Steam via that, and then download and run Roller Coast Tycoon 2 from Steam. Great! </p></div></div></div><div class="col-sm order-first order-md-last"><div class="toc"><h4>Table of Contents</h4><div class="toc"><div class="post-titles"><ul><li><a href="/posts/2021-02-04/notes-from-a-discussion-on-handling-emergency-service-outages.html">Notes from a Discussion on Handling Emergency Service Outages</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2021-02-02/roller-coast-tycoon.html">Roller Coast Tycoon</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2021-02-01/starting-with-github-actions.html">Starting with GitHub Actions</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2021-01-26/markdown-parser-converter-round-1.html">Markdown Parser Converter Round 1</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2021-01-24/my-plan-for-this-blog-right-now.html">My Plan For This Blog Right Now</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2021-01-22/post-1.html">Post #1</a></li></ul></div><div class="post-tags"><h5>Tags</h5><ul><li>computergames</li><li>technical</li><li>meta</li><li>software-design</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><br><br><br><div class="row"><div class="footer"><p>The code to generate this website is at <a href="https://github.com/spencerminer/blog/">github.com/spencerminer/blog/</a></p></div></div></div><script crossorigin="anonymous" integrity="sha384-ygbV9kiqUc6oa4msXn9868pTtWMgiQaeYH7/t7LECLbyPA2x65Kgf80OJFdroafW" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
