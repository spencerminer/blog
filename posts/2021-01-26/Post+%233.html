I perhaps should've made smaller, more frequent posts, but I got very excited and motivated working on the things I'm about to describe.</p><p>First of all, I'm now writing this in a Markdown file which my IDE renders in live time, which is a much nicer experience that writing prose into a vector in the body of Clojure code. When the `generate-index-html!` function is called, it iterates through all the markdown blog post files in this folder, does some woefully incomplete parsing of the Markdown and converts each post into a Clojure hashmap with some metadata. The function then turns that vector of blog post hashmaps into Hiccup code and puts the posts in the main section of the webpage.</p><p>I decided to read all the Markdown posts into a vector of blog post hashmaps so that I could use it for multiple things on the website. For one, itis used to populate the Table of Contents. It is also used to create unique pages for each post, which I'll soon be linking to in the Table of Contents.</p><p>I think I'll split the Github Actions deployment description into a separate post for now.</p></div></div></html>
