I perhaps should've made smaller, more frequent posts, but I got very excited and motivated working on the things I'm about to describe.</p><p>First of all, I'm now writing this in a Markdown file which my IDE renders in live time, which is a much nicer experience that writing prose into a vector in the body of Clojure code. When the `generate-index-html!` function is called, it iterates through all the markdown blog post files in this folder, does some woefully incomplete parsing of the Markdown and converts each post into a Clojure hashmap with some metadata. The function then turns that vector of blog post hashmaps into Hiccup code and puts the posts in the main section of the webpage.</p><p>I decided to read all the Markdown posts into a vector of blog post hashmaps so that I could use it for multiple things on the website. For one, it is used to populate the Table of Contents. It is also used to create unique pages for each post, which I'll soon be linking to in the Table of Contents.</p><p>I think I'll split the Github Actions deployment description into a separate post for now.</p></div></div><div class="row"><h3>Post #2</h3><h5>2021-01-24</h5><div class="post-body"><p>Maybe I'll make this into a design diary (à la Stonemaier Games design diaries) for now.</p><p>Right now I'm just typing strings into vectors that [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup), a Clojure library, will turn into HTML code, which I'll push to Github. I hope to be able to write notes in Markdown that my program will convert into Clojure data structures with lots of metadata that will be put into Hiccup to make HTML. That's the dream. Probably not too hard if I'm able to devote some time to figuring it out.</p><p>I also want to make the layout and styling look decent. I am starting using Bootstrap, but it's very rudimentary right now (something that future people reading this hopefully won't be able to see). I have a lot of learning and experimenting to do. Including figuring out how to balance time between writing the blog and making the blog.</p><p>Teaser for next time: I remembered Github actions and discovered Git Auto Commit! https://github.com/marketplace/actions/git-auto-commit</p></div></div><div class="row"><h3>Post #1</h3><h5>2021-01-22</h5><div class="post-body"><p>I pledge that these blog posts will either:</p><ul><li>be short, or</li><li>have lots of pictures/diagrams</li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="col-sm order-first order-md-last"><div class="toc"><h4>Table of Contents</h4><div class="post-titles"><ul><li><a href="/posts/2021-01-22/post-1.html">Post #1</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2021-01-24/post-2.html">Post #2</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2021-01-26/post-3.html">Post #3</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><br><br><div class="row"><div class="footer"><p>The code to generate this website is at <a href="https://github.com/spencerminer/blog/">github.com/spencerminer/blog/</a></p></div></div></div><script crossorigin="anonymous" integrity="sha384-ygbV9kiqUc6oa4msXn9868pTtWMgiQaeYH7/t7LECLbyPA2x65Kgf80OJFdroafW" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
