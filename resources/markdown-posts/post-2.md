## My Plan For This Blog Right Now
##### 2021-01-24

Maybe I'll make this into a design diary (Ã  la Stonemaier Games design 
diaries) for now.

Right now I'm just typing strings into vectors that 
[Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup), a Clojure library, will turn 
into HTML code, which I'll push to Github. I hope to be able to write notes in 
Markdown that my program will convert into Clojure data structures with lots 
of metadata that will be put into Hiccup to make HTML. That's the dream. 
Probably not too hard if I'm able to devote some time to figuring it out.

I also want to make the layout and styling look decent. I am starting using 
Bootstrap, but it's very rudimentary right now (something that future people 
reading this hopefully won't be able to see). I have a lot of learning and 
experimenting to do. Including figuring out how to balance time between 
writing the blog and making the blog.

Teaser for next time: I remembered Github actions and discovered Git Auto 
Commit! https://github.com/marketplace/actions/git-auto-commit
