## Roller Coast Tycoon

Roller Coaster Tycoon is a classic theme park simulator computer game. I 
played the second edition that came out in 2002. I recently rediscovered the 
game and am amazed by how fun it still is to put together roller coasters, 
set prices for hamburger stands, strategically place benches and trash cans 
on paths near nauseating rides, run marketing campaigns, and listen in on 
the thoughts of the park visitors. The isometric view and low-res graphics 
are very attractive and the sound effects really make it feel fun and alive.

Unfortunately it only runs on Windows machines, and I have a Mac. A few 
years ago I was able to figure out how to get it working with 
[Wine](https://www.winehq.org/), a compatability layer that translates 
Windows operating system API calls into code that Unix-based operating 
systems, like macOS, can understand. But Wine can't yet handle 64-bit apps, 
so it's been broken on macOS Catalina, which doesn't let you run 32-bit apps.
Luckily I was able to find [PlayOnMac](https://www.playonmac.com/en/), which 
apparently has been adapted to be able to handle 64-bit apps, so I was able 
to install that, install Windows Steam via that, and then download and run 
Roller Coast Tycoon 2 from Steam. Great!
